# first-project
I have an Excel file that contains 6 columns and 170 thousand rows, which I attached to the project.
The numbers in columns A and F are the value of an indicator at the opening and closing moment of each candle, respectively. Columns B to E are also ohlc of each candle.
If you look carefully, columns A and F of each row are very close to each other. In fact, the value of column F is the value obtained by changing the value of columns B to E.
What I want from the project is a code that can give me the value of column A by giving columns B to F. Use any method, it doesn't matter, I just want to make column A with the lowest percentage of errors.
